## Weigh-In-Motion Data Files Manamgement Script

### Introduction:
WIM Files downloaded using vendor autopolling software either need to be downloaded to a pool structure or individually to stations for reports to work properly. Transportation Data Program for State of Alaska have had the files partitioned by station name, which makes it easy to locate but difficult to package and organize the files. These set of scripts seek to assist in managing those files.
